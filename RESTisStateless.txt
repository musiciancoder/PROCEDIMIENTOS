Are rest Web services stateless? yes, statelessness is one of the key principles of rest Web services,

that is, we shouldn't be maintaining any state in our application or the server on which the application is running.

That doesn't mean there is no state at all.

When the clients send the request, they should include all those details that are required to perform a certain business logic or operation.

That is, the state will be transferred across the client and the server instead of maintaining it in one location on the server, like a session, etc..
