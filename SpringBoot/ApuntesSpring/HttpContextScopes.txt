 HTTP context scopes --> request session and global. 

Request scope is where a new bean instance will be created for every HTTP request coming in.

Session scope is where there will be only one bean instance used across the session, that is, will have multiple HTTP requests and responses happening within a given session, for all those requests and responses, the same bean instance will be used.

The global or global session makes sense only if we are using Portlets within our application and this scope applies across portlets It's like a global session which we can have across portlets and the same bean will be used across this global session or Portlets.
