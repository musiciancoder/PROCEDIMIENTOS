@SpringBootApplication is the starting point of every spring boot application where all the magic happens.

It is a top level annotation, which contains three other important annotations.

Inside it, they are the @SpringBootConfiguration @EnableAutoConfiguration and @ComponentScan.

@SpringBootConfiguration tells spring this class can have bean definitions with @Bean annotation
@EnableAutoConfiguration enables springboot autoconfiguration from starters libraries in the pom.
@ComponentScan tells Spring boot that it should scan throughnall the sub packages of the current package.
Wherever this class lives, which is marked with the @ComponentScan annotation indirectly through
the Spring boot application, it should scan that package and all the sub packages for the spring beans
that are marked with @Component, @Sservice, @Repository, etc. and use them for dependency injection
at runtime.
