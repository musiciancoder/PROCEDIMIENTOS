Both these annotations are used to mark the controller classes , the controller annotation is used to mark a class that is a part of a typical Web application.
And the methods in this class are expected to return back a view which could be a JSP, a timely template, etc. that should go back to a Web browser, whereas the rest controller is used to mark the restful
end point are the rest controllers, which expose out restful APIs, the rest controller annotation is a combination of the controller annotation, plus the response body annotation.
It is internally marked with the response body annotation. And unlike the Web application controller classes, the rest controller class methods will return backa domain object, not a view, but a domain object.
And thanks to this response body, it will take care of converting these domain objects into JSON or other formats required by the restful client applications.
