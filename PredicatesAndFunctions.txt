PREDICATE
What is a predicate, a predicate is a function with a single argument that returns a boolean, true

or false back. To create a predicate, we use the functional interface predicate that takes a generic

type, and it has a single method called test that takes the generic type and returns a boolean value

back.

Since it is a functional interface, we can express it using lambda expressions.


FUNCTION
What is the function? Function is just like a predicate, except for it can return any type of value,

not just a boolean value we can pass in what type of data it will accept and the return type as well.

And we can express it as a lambda expression because it has only one method called apply it is a functional

interface with a method called apply.

Whatever logic we implement using the lambda expression will be used and that value will be returned

back instead of a boolean value.
