How do you monitor the health of your microservice applications?

Laundering The health of microservices includes gathering the data, storing their data from your

microservice applications, analyzing it, and then reporting it to develop insights for the future.

When we use Spring Boot, we can use the spring boot actuator, which is super simple to configure to

know the health details of our microservice.

But when it comes to multiple microservices, we need tools like prometheus, ELK stack and

more.

Prometheus is a monitoring tool for application level monitoring.

It is used to record actions over time.

As the actions happen within our application, we log that data. Grafana is used along with prometheus

to provide a dashboard to visualize that data.

ELK stack comprises of three tools.

E stands for Elasticsearch, L stands for Log Stash, and K stands for Kibana.

Elasticsearch allows us to store the logs, log stash helps us to ship and process the logs and then

store that data, and kibana allows us to visualize that data.

Kibana is a visualization tool.

Elk provides centralized logging, which is useful when attempting to identify the problems within our

applications and servers.

Nagios, on the other hand, helps us to monitor the infrastructure when it comes to routers, servers,

etc. We can use NagIOS within our infrastructure to monitor the entire infrastructure as we automate

it.
