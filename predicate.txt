What is a predicate, a predicate is a function with a single argument that returns a boolean, true

or false back. To create a predicate, we use the functional interface predicate that takes a generic

type, and it has a single method called test that takes the generic type and returns a boolean value

back.

Since it is a functional interface, we can express it using lambda expressions.
