Continuous delivery: extends continous integration and runs production like tests (acceptance tests) in a stage environment (ambiente de prueba) automatically. The last step (deployment) can be made manually, and it is not automated
Continous deployment: No more manual steps, everything is projected automatically into deployment throughout automated Commit/Build/Test/Stage(environments)/Deploy
